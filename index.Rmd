My name is Logan Jensen and I am an aspiring data scientist who is passionate about using data to tell stories and offer insight. I'm currently studying Data Science at Brigham Young University - Idaho, where I have taken classes involving Non-parametric Statistical Modeling, Data Wrangling and Visualization, SQL Database Development, Object-oriented Programming, and many other topics. I'm experienced in R, Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI and other software and I love to learn and am always looking for opportunities to practice further.

I originally started school looking to become a Physical Therapist. I commenced the Exercise Physiology program and began taking Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Anatomy Classes. These classes I found very enjoyable, but my life course changed when I took my first college statistics course. I realized that my heart and brain thrived on data, and though I do believe I would've loved working in the medical field, I know I am truly studying my passion now that I am in Data Science.

Please check out my projects. I feel very confident working in R, which is what I've dedicated this sight to. I'm looking for opportunities to learn more and I know I could be a valuable asset to any data-centered team.
