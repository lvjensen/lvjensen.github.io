      <h5 class="">January 2020 - Present <span>&#8226;</span> Tempe, Arizona</h5>
      <p >At Circle K, I work inside the Global Data and Analytics team where we are working to reform
        how analytics influences decisions within Circle K. My main tasks has been to develop Power BI Dashboards
        in order to communicate business intelligence, automate ETL and data wrangling process to be scalable,
        and actuvely participate in the price optimization initiative that has already produced results netting an
        increase of tens of millions of dollars in margin annually.</p>

      <p >While working at the Enrollment Management department at BYU- Idaho, I was involved in adapting current
        analytics practices into more innovative solutions. Major tasks included building scripts to sort through
        tens of thousands of storage data exports and format them into consistent databases, converting data tables
        into simple and interactive Power BI dashboards and forecasting expected counts for enrollments, student
        housing and student applications.</p>

      <p >As a Data Science Consultant with the PTEC, they posed a problem while struggling with data organization
        and consumption. To simplify things, I built an R package that pulled and organized data from current and
        previous years. This package facilitated this process from taking weeks to months to a couple of minutes,
        saving numerous man hours. Additionally, I offer consulting with R to help offer more tools for data analysis
        to the coalition.</p>

      <p >With Pathway Worlwide I was the intern in charge of analytics, thus innovating the way they did mentoring.
        I created a statistical model that helped mentors focus on students that were most at risk to drop out and then
        developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI that pulled from several resources to put it all in one place.
        Additionally I created a shiny R application to dynamically display job figures and total jobs available from
        sources like Indeed.</p>

      <p >The SCOT program had insufficient and ineffective ways of analyzing their survey results. I put together a
        group of other consultants and we innovated through the design thinking process to come up with many solutions
        to our problem. We created a Shiny R application to upload survey results and immediately produce results for
        most common student complaints and largest areas of concern and strength.</p>
